## Description

Instead of a final exam, you will be solving challenges related to the course
material in the class capture the flag (CTF) event. The registration information
is provided on ELMS and in the class Discord server. You can access the event
here:

> <span style="font-family: monospace">[https://ctf.hacs408e.net](https://ctf.hacs408e.net)</span>

### Competition

You will be competing in the same teams you formed for the midterm
presentations. The team with the most points at the end of class will get a 100%
as their final grade (provided they have met the point threshold). Members of
the winning team also will not have to submit write-ups for challenges.

### Challenge Write-Ups

If you're team does not win, or you do not wish to participate in the
competition then you will submit an individual report of at least `600 points`
worth of challenges. Similar to the lab/homework assignments you been doing all
class, you will submit an explanation of each of the challenges you solved and
how you solved them including screenshots and links to sources you found online
as necessary.

**Challenges:**

Most of the challenges are pulled from popular CTF events online and will be of
the form: <br> `name{some_characters_12345}`

### Grading

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You must submit at least `600 points` worth of challenges to receive full
> credit.

Your final grade in ELMS is worth 30 points and so each of your challenge
write-ups will be applied proportionally to this score. For example, the
`Wireshark III` challenge is worth `100 points`. Out of the six hundred needed
for your write-up this challenge makes up `16.66` percent. Translating that to
the 30 points of your final grade, sixteen percent of thirty is `5 pts`. So this
challenge write up is worth 5/30 points towards your total final grade.

The number of points a challenge is worth loosely corresponds to difficulty, so
if you attempt only the harder challenges but don't quite find the flag that is
okay. The difficulty of your attempt will be taken into account during grading.
However, you must find the correct flag in order to get full points on each of
the challenges you use in your write-up.

Your report should explain your thought process and show how you worked through
each of the challenges. If you use any online references, please provide a URL
to the source. Each challenge explanation should be concise, and you should
explain how the challenge relates to concepts you learned in class. Points may
be taken off for clarity and report quality.
