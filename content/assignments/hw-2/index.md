## Description

For this assignment you will be completing each stage of the challenge binary
provided. There are 10 stages with different challenges of varying degrees of
difficulty. Each stage is worth 2 points and you must include a write up
describing how you solved each challenge. It doesn't need to be very lengthy,
but you MUST INCLUDE an analysis of the assembly instructions that were critical
to solving the challenge. You will not receive full points if you only include
the solution. You will also not receive full points if you only show the
binaryninja decompiler. It is a great tool to help with your analysis but
inspection of the assembly code is required for full points.
