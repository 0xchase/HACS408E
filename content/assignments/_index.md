There will be a homework assignment associated with almost every topic covered
in class so make sure to complete all the labs. Assignments will be due
approximately every two weeks. Please see the schedule below (and on the class
webpage) for exact due dates. Every assignment will require understanding the
tools and techniques described in the associated weekâ€™s lecture. Students must
complete a write-up of their results, explaining their analysis methods and
possibly answering some questions.

Please submit a PDF copy of your write-up to ELMS and ensure that any
screenshots or images you use are rendered properly.
