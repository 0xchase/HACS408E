There will be a homework assignment associated with almost every topic covered in class. Assignments will be grouped together and due approximately every two weeks. Please see the schedule below (and on the class webpage) for exact due dates. Every assignment will require understanding the tools and techniques described in the associated weekâ€™s lecture. Students must complete a write-up of their results, explaining their analysis methods and possibly answering some questions. You must submit a pdf copy of the report to ELMS with working images.
