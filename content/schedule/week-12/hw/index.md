## Description

For this homework assignment you will be analyzing malware written in the Go programming language.

TODO: More context.

{{< callout type=error >}}

NOTE: The following ransomware has been altered so it shouldn't encrypt any of your files
but it is still malware! It will affect your system (though not in any irreversible way).
Please be careful and only run this file on a windows VM.

{{< downloadbutton file=ransomware.zip text=ransomware.zip >}}

The password to decrypt the zip file is: `its-magically-malicious`

{{< /callout >}}

### Part 1: Dynamic Analysis (3 Pts)

Run the malware in a VM while using procmon. Ignore ALL REGISTRY operations, they are not important for this program. (3 points / bullet)

- Describe what happens to your system. Any noticable changes? Any files created?

- Verify that files were created by showing a screenshot of the event(s) in procmon.

- What program is being searched for in many different places?

Run the program a second time (procmon is not necessary). Is the execution different?


### Part 2: Static Analysis (9 Pts)

Part of go programming is using libraries which generally come from github repos. Find <u>**3 unique repositories**</u> referenced in the malware. Look up the repository and explain what they are for. (1 point)

Using proof from ghidra or any other analysis sources answer the following questions (2 points / bullet):

 - Explain how the ransomware knows if you've already been infected.

 - Explain how the ransomware changes your wallpaper.

 - What data is in the `BAD_GOPHER.txt` file and where does the contents of this file get generated in the code?

 - Find the main decryption function and show the control-flow path from the `main.main` function. In other words, specify the name of each function called from `main.main` --> `<decrypt function>`. 
   - HINT: Ghidra has a `Function Call Trees` window that might be helpful.
