## Overview

{{< callout emoji="💡" >}}

In this lab you will perform an in-depth analysis of our malware sample. You may use all of the tools we previously covered, though it's expected that this portion is easiest to complete with Ghidra.

**Goals:**

- Gain familiarity with PE reverse engineering
- Look for indicators of compromise
- Look for elements of the malware that might be signatured

**Estimated Time:** `60 Minutes`

## Questions

Since this is a malware sample, there are some key questions you should address in your writeup.

- Does this sample connect to the internet?
- Is there a way to disable this sample on infected machines?
- Does this sample implement persistance mechanisms?
- What indicators that a machine is compromised with this sample?
- What malicious payload does this sample implement or deliver?
- What is the overall purpose of this sample?

## Hints

- Real-world malware can be bloated and complicated. Don't try to understand what every function does.
- Look for key functions using information identified in the previous lab and focus on those
- Look at the cross-references to important strings, imports, and functions
