## Description

For this homework you will triage a router firmware, which can be downloaded in
three parts.

{{< downloadbutton file=FW_WRT1900ACSV2_2.0.3.201002_prod.zip text="Part 1" >}}

{{< downloadbutton file=FW_WRT1900ACSV2_2.0.3.201002_prod.z01 text="Part 2" >}}

{{< downloadbutton file=FW_WRT1900ACSV2_2.0.3.201002_prod.z02 text="Part 3" >}}

### Download the firmware

Since the firmware image is large, and github has file size limits, your
firmware is distributed as a multi-part zip file. To reconstruct it, you should
download all three parts into the same directory, and then run the following
`7z` command.

```
7z e FW_WRT1900ACSV2_2.0.3.201002_prod.zip
```

If all three parts are in the same directory, the extraction should create a
file named `FW_WRT1900ACSV2_2.0.3.201002_prod.img`.

### Dump the image strings

Run the `strings` command (with relevant flags) on the `img` file and answer the
following questions.

- What type of device is this firmware for (printer, router, camera, etc.)?
- What is the full brand and device name for this firmware?
- What kinds of files do you see embedded in the image? What do these files
  imply about the firmware's funtionality?

### Extract the image

Next you should extract the file system from the `img` using either
[binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) or
[unblob](https://unblob.org/installation/).

**Note:** You may need to install an external dependency that binwalk or unblob
depends on for the extraction to succeed.

### Browse the file system

Find and examine the file system, answering the following questions in your
report.

- What assembly architecture does this firmware use? Hint: find a binary and run
  the `file` command on it.
- What version of the linux kernel does this firmware use? When was this version
  released? Does it have any known vulnerabilities?
- `cd` in to the `/etc` folder and use its contents to answer the following
  - What firmware version is this?
  - When was this firmware built?
  - What SSH client does it run?
- Does this firmware contain a web server?
  - What program (specify the full path) is responsible for serving the web
    content?
  - Where are the files in the file system corresponding to the web content? Are
    they `html`/`javascript` files or something else?
- Is the `shadow` file included in the file system? Which accounts have a
  password set?
- Look for configuration files in the system. Pick one and write a short
  overview of what it is used for.
- Find a file with an extension (`.txt`, `.exe`, etc..) that you don't
  recognize. Google this file type and explain what it is used for.

## Tips

- Use google if you encounter errors
- Ask questions in the Discord
- If `binwalk` or `unblob` doesn't work the first time, keep trying
