explaination

Now we get to use the de-facto file analysis tool: `binwalk`. Developed by
ReFirmLabs, now owned by Microsoft it uses
[Magic Bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number) as well as
other signatures to figure out what files are contained in any blob of data
(like firmware for example).

Create a copy of the firmware file and call it `firmware.bin`. Then run binwalk
on it:
