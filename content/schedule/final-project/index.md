## Description

For your final project, you will be working on tasks 3, 4, and 5 of the
[codebreaker challenge](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/challenge). The last two
lectures of class will be dedicated work periods rather than the normal
lecture/lab content. You can ask questions of the instructors and get tips on
how to progress if you are stuck.

{{< callout type=error >}}

The codebreaker challenge is meant to be completed individually! We cannot share
answers with you, nor should you share your solution with other students.

This challenge will be difficult, and will require you to leverage many of the
tools and concepts covered in this class to solve. It is also likely that you
will need to spend a lot of time google-ing how things work and teach yourself
new concepts on the fly. This is the essence of reverse engineering. Given the
difficulty and the fact that you must complete the challenges in order, we have
adjusted the grades accordingly (see below).

{{< callout emoji="📝" >}}

The challenge is being tracked through the codebreaker website, so make sure you
[share your progress](/schedule/week-12/hw/) with the instructor(s)! If you
complete all three tasks, then no write-up is necessary and you will receive a
`35/30` or `116.67%` as the grade for your final.

Points may be deducted for the quality of your report, not demonstrating the
concepts learned, etc. Your report should be clear and nicely formatted. Include
any information you learned while researching any of the technologies used by
the challenge programs.

As always, the write-up and any code you wrote should be submitted to
[ELMS](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1374508/assignments).
