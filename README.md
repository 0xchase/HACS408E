# HACS408E: Reverse Engineering

**Couse Description**: _This course introduces students to the tools and
techniques required to analyze the security properties of various systems.
Topics covered include assembly language, executable file formats, operating
system internals, and the static/dynamic analysis of compiled binaries. Students
will apply these concepts to real-world scenarios like malware analysis and
vulnerability analysis with interactive labs, at-home assignments, and a final
project._

**Notes:**

- TODO: Week 12 is missing content! Our original schedule had this as the
  Android week and week 13 as final project but this leaves basically 4 weeks of
  nothing at the end of the semester.
- Week of fall break, maybe add an optional extra credit assignment?
- Announce the final project at the end of the android lecture?

### TODO: ?

- Bootable USB sticks with locked-down Windows

## Miscellaneous Ideas

- Reverse the [Feisti and TDL3](https://github.com/bootkitsbook/rootkits)
  rootkits from _Rootkits and Bootkits_ book
- Utilize Pwn Island 3? Potentially some performance issues.
- Malware from Practical Malware Analysis or Mastering Malware Analysis
- Trigger malware kill switch by registering domain
- Fuzzing
- Implementing common reverse engineering tools
- Symbolic execution
- Non-compiled code
- Android Apk Analysis, Jadx
- Frida Dynamic Analysis Framework
- Intel Pin / Dynamorio DBI
- Fuzzing + AFL

## Policies

### Each Week
