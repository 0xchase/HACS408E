\section*{Analysis}
Your objective is to find a way for the binary to execute the function that
prints the "You made it!" message. Use any Reverse Engineering tool(s) of your
choice. Feel free to turn off ASLR, note this in the write up. Write your solution
below in detail and explain how and why your solution achieves the objective.
