**Explaination:**

Triage 5 binaries using simple static analysis tools.

<u>Goals:</u>

- Undestand how to investigate binary files.
- Become familliar with well known linux commands for static analysis:
  - `xxd`, `strings`, `file`, `ldd`
- Understand file formats and magic bytes

{{< /callout >}}

For each of the Following files, complete the steps below and answer questions.

{{< downloadbutton file="file_1.bin" text="File 1" >}}

{{< downloadbutton file="file_2.bin" text="File 2" >}}

{{< downloadbutton file="file_3.bin" text="File 3" >}}

{{< downloadbutton file="file_4.bin" text="File 4" >}}

{{< downloadbutton file="file_5.bin" text="File 5" >}}

## Instructions

1. First look at the bytes of the file using a hex viewer.
   - For example:
     ```sh
     sudo apt install hexyl
     hexyl <file_##> | less -R
     ```

- Do you notice any patterns in the binary? See any strings?

1. Next use the `file` command, to examine the file.

   - Provide an explaination of what type of file this is.
   - What are the magic bytes used to identify the file type?

1. If the binary is an **ELF** is it `static` or `dynamic`?

   - Use `ldd` to find the dynamic libraries the executable relies on and
     explain what each shared object is.
   - Does this give you any indication of what the program does?

1. Lastly use the `strings` binary to look for, well strings.

   - Compare the differences between the `--data` flag and `--all` flag by
     saving both versions to a file and running `diff` on the two files.
   - Increase the minimum length from `4` to `15`. What effect does this have?
     Do you think there may be drawbacks?

## Tips

- Non-executable files can still be interesting!
- If any of the data is compressed, try to decompress it
  to see what's inside.

1. Some of the files are from the
   [pico CTF practice page](https://play.picoctf.org/practice).
   If you find the flags, (i.e `picoCTF{########}`) add them to your lab write up.
